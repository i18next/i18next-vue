# Single file components: `<i18n>` <Badge type="danger" text="Removed in 3.0" />

::: danger NOTE
`<i18n>` blocks are no longer supported since `i18next-vue` v3. This is probably already not working in v2,
because there are no Vue 3 loaders producing the right format.
:::

Single File Components could have an `<i18n>` block for defining translations locally in the component before the removal.
