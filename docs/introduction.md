[i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) goes beyond just providing the standard i18n features such as plurals, context, interpolation, format. It provides you with a complete solution to localize your product from web to mobile and desktop.

i18next-vue brings Vue support for i18next and provides:

* Component based localization
* Lazy loading namespaces
* Namespaced translation for components
